Our student branch organizes multiple networking events connecting students to industry professionals such as WIE Tech Panel and Wine and Cheese.

Wine & Cheese provides an opportunity for students in engineering to expand their network and spark valuable discussions in a low-pressure environment with experts, professionals, faculty, and fellow students in their interested career fields and create lasting bonds for years to come.

This event is open to ALL students. It is an opportunity to hear some of the most inspiring and accomplished women speak about their experiences and their journey to success!

On top of that, you'll get to build meaningful connections with panellists and other industry professionals.
